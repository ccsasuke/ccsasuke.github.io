# [Research](#research)
I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods that can be used to automatically learn the underlying knowledge in languages.

On the methodology side, I am intrigued by elegant models with end-to-end training,  such as the capability of Deep Neural Networks to learn powerful representations without explicitly injecting human knowledge. I am also interested in structured prediction models that can handle complex output spaces since NLP problems usually have structured outputs.

On the application side, I am very interested in extracting and understanding knowledge behind languages, such as Question Answering, Reading Comprehension, or representation learning.

Recently, my proposed thesis research focuses on studying Adversarial Neural Networks with applications in NLP, particularly for cross-lingual and cross-domain adaptation.

# [Experiences](#experience)
05.2017 - 08.2017, **Facebook**, Menlo Park, CA,<br>
*PhD Intern working with the Search NLP team*\\
Worked on Aspect Extraction on review data. E.g. In review `I like the food but the service is terrible.`, the system should extract `food` as a positive aspect while extracting `service` as a negative one.

05.2016 - 08.2016, **IBM Research**, San Jose, CA,<br>
*Research Intern with the Scalable NLP team*\\
Worked on understanding the structure and semantics of tabular data in financial documents.
Our paper was published on ICDAR 2017.

05.2015 - 08.2015, **Google**, Mountain View, CA,<br>
*PhD Intern with the Display Ads Predictive Targeting team*\\
Implemented a new targeting model based on Slope One collaborative filtering to recommend keywords to Ads for better coverage using only keyword performance statistics.

05.2012 - 02.2013, **Microsoft Research Asia**, Beijing, China,<br>
*Full-time Intern working on Machine Translation with Dr. Dongdong Zhang and Dr. Ming Zhou*
Designed an all-in-one GUI Auto Trainer for the Machine Translation pipeline of MSRA.
Participated in a real-time speech-to-speech machine translation task ([News](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20266427), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-nlQqFCKg))

# [Miscellaneous](#misc)
I cook on a daily basis when I'm stuck in Ithaca where good Chinese food is scarce.

I do <span class="illustrations"><a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#archeryModal">archery</a></span> (mostly indoor Olympic-style recurve archery) in my spare time, and sometimes go skiing when weather permits.

<div id="archeryModal" class="modal" role="dialog">
